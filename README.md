# Rock-Paper-Sissor-OpenCV-Python
Created the famous Rock Paper Scissor Game in Python using OpenCV , so you don't need to press any buttons to play , use your hand to play.

## Inspiration
The challenge's theme is non-conventional input, And I have seen all the rock-paper-scissors games require us to press buttons, so I created this rock-paper-scissor game that doesn't need any buttons, all you need to do is rock-paper-scissor-shoot.

## What it does
It lets us play Rock Paper Scissors the old-school way, by using our hands instead of button inputs. So you can play the game just like you used to in school. Just make sure you have a webcam so that the bot can see your moves.

## How I built it
It was built completely in Python, using openCV. OpenCV is used for detecting player moves so that the bot knows whether you have played rock, paper, or scissors.

## What I learned
Learned a lot about openCV, even though I have used it before, I explored a lot of new things about it, also learned how to use the hand detection feature of openCV which is really cool. 

## What's next for No-Buttons Rock-Paper-Scissor 
I will have it on my desktop & play it whenever I am bored and need a quick and easy game to play. I will also share the game with my friends and peers for them to enjoy it.
The game is coded in such a way that it's super easy to set up, all you need is Python 3.6-3.9 to be installed in your system, and all modules required will be installed automatically by the game.
